## User Experience (UX)
### Wireframes
The wireframes for the website were produced in Balsamiq. There are frames for a full width display. The final site varies slightly from the wireframes due to developments that occured during the creation process.

### Design Choices
- Typography
  - The fonts chosen were 'Oswald' for the headings and 'Poppins' for the body text. They fall back to sans-serif respectively.
  - Poppins is an easily readable font, and Oswald was selected via https://typ.io/search
  
- Colour Scheme
  - The leading colour is a shade of green, which fits perfectly with the theme of the Northern Lights.
  - The colours were selected via http://colormind.io/

| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Render | passed | passed | passed | passed | passed | passed | passed |
| Images | passed | passed | passed | passed | passed | passed | passed |
| Links | passed | passed | passed | passed | passed | passed | passed |

All responsiveness tests were successful. The site is ready to work with devices of various widths. In addition, the site has been adapted to large screens above 1440px.

### Browser Compatibility

The website was tested on the following browsers with no visible issues for the user:
- Google Chrome
- Microsoft Edge
- Mozilla Firefox
 
Appearance, functionality and responsiveness were consistent throughout for a range of device sizes and browsers.

### Unfixed Bugs

There are no known unfixed bugs on this site.

### Additional Testing

The site was also tested using Lighthouse Chrome Dev Tools to test each of the pages for:

  - Performance - How the page performs whilst loading.
  - Accessibility - Is the site acccessible for all users and how can it be improved.
  - Best Practices - Site conforms to industry best practices.
  - SEO - Search engine optimisation. Is the site optimised for search engine result rankings.

Here are the desktop parameters of each repository page:

- index.html

Despite the relatively good parameters, performance can be increased by serving images in next-gen formats like WebP and AVIF. The purpose of the site is also to download photos from the gallery if the user likes them. JPG and PNG image files are compatible with almost all devices available on the market.

1. In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab.
2. Once in Settings, navigate to the Pages tab on the left-hand side.
